# ECE302 - Computer Architecture Coursework

This is a comprehensive collection of coursework for the ECE302 Computer Architecture course. It comprises a series of VHDL scripts designed to explore and elucidate various aspects of computer architecture, specifically focusing on the design and implementation of single-cycle and multi-cycle processors.

## Single Cycle Processor

Located in the `Single Cycle` directory, this project involves the design and implementation of a single-cycle processor. A single-cycle processor is a type of processor where each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle. This project provides a hands-on experience with the design of such a processor, including the design of the datapath and control unit, and various components such as ALU, registers, and memory.

## Multi Cycle Processor

Located in the `Multi Cycle` directory, this project involves the design and implementation of a multi-cycle processor. A multi-cycle processor is a type of processor where instructions can take more than one clock cycle to execute. This allows for a more efficient use of the processor's resources as different stages of instruction execution can overlap in time. This project provides a hands-on experience with the design of a multi-cycle processor, including the design of the datapath and control unit, and various components such as ALU, registers, and memory.
